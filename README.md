A simple web-based tool that checks if a URL looks suspicious or unsafe.  
Built for the **Hack4thon** event.

### 🚀 Features

- Detects the use of '@' symbol inside URLs
- Simple and clean UI
- Fully frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) — works on GitHub Pages

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- CSS
- JavaScript (No backend)

### 📦 How It Works
The script scans the URL and looks for:

- Length of the URL  
- Special characters commonly used in phishing
